# Serial_Communication_2

We utilized two microcontrollers and their respective boards, which we refer to as Micro1 and Micro 2. 
From Micro 1, we output a character that Micro 2 would read and then transfer to the computer to be displayed via RS232. 
We set the character ‘g’ to be displayed once so whenever we run the programs on the microcontrollers, a ‘g’ is displayed on screen.
