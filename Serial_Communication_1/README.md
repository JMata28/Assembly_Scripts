# Serial_Communication_1
We created a system that allows the microcontrollers to receive data serially and immediately output it. 
We used the Tera Term software in a computer with an RS232 serial port to read the data that was output from the computer. 
Whichever character we typed in the Tera Term software was immediately displayed on screen after being read and then output 
by the microcontroller.
